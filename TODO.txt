These is a simple list of things I need to keep track of.

TODO: Get email working.
      Should email managers when there are new announcements,
      when cast in a show or scheduled on a shift,
      and 24 hours prior to a cast shift call time.

TODO: Shows need roles so that auto-schedule will try not to schedule US on US
      shows and ISP on ISP shows.

TODO: Add a print function to the dashboard(?)

TODO: Add Volunteer role with extreamly limited access.

TODO: Add emergency contact information to member record(?)
