These is a simple list of things I need to keep track of.

ToDo: Should send emails:
DONE  - to managers when new annoucements are created.
TODO  - members when cast in a show or scheduled on a shift,
TODO  - crew members 24 hours prior to a cast shift call time.

ToDo: Shows need roles so that auto-schedule will try not to schedule US on US shows and ISP on ISP shows.

ToDo: Add a print function for the dashboard(?)

ToDo: Add Volunteer role with extreamly limited access.

ToDo: Add emergency contact information to member record(?)
